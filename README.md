## How to install IBM's Qiskit on your laptop

Official install doc: <https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html>

Note: as recently as 28-Nov-2019, Qiskit did not work with Python 3.8. You can specify Python 3.7 by doing:<br>
`$ conda create -n name_of_my_env python=3.7`

The basic procedure is (this does not replace the install doc above):
1. Install Anaconda
2. Create virtual environment using `conda create ...` and activate it.
3. Pip install qiskit
4. Start Anaconda, or restart if already running.
5. In Anaconda, select your virtual env.
6. Within Anaconda, install Jupyter Notebook - will install into your selected virtual env. (JupyterLab **may** also work.)
7. Launch Jupyter Notebook
